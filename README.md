#HTTP Resource Adapter [![Build Status](http://ec2-52-5-86-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com/job/http-jca/badge/icon?style=plastic)](http://ec2-52-5-86-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com/job/http-jca/) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ozoli/http-jca-adaptor/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/ozoli/http-jca-adaptor?branch=develop)
This HTTP Resource is an implementation of the [Java EE Java Connector Architecture 1.6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE_Connector_Architecture) using the [Apache HTTP client](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) as the underlying HTTP implementation. 

##Examples
Coming soon! At least a simple HTTP example for WildFly / JBoss and another using a Jersey client.

##Support
Please submit any **HTTP-JCA** bugs, issues, and feature requests to [ozoli/http-jca-adaptor](//github.com/ozoli/http-jca-adaptor/issues).
